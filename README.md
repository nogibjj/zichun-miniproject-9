# Cloud-Hosted Jupyter Notebook Data Manipulation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data manipulation tasks using a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab. It includes setup, configuration, and a CI/CD pipeline, showcasing data cleaning, aggregation, filtering, and transformation techniques on a sample dataset.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Open the Notebook**: Use the provided Google Colab link to access the notebook.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: The necessary libraries (like `pandas`, `numpy`) will be installed in the notebook if not pre-installed on Google Colab.

## Data Manipulation Tasks
The following data manipulation tasks are performed in the notebook:
1. **Data Loading**: Load a dataset from Google Drive or a URL.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
3. **Aggregation**: Group data and calculate statistics such as mean or sum.
4. **Filtering**: Filter data based on specific conditions.
5. **Transformation**: Create new columns and apply transformations.
6. **Sorting**: Sort data based on columns.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD to ensure code quality and functionality. The pipeline includes:
- **Linting**: Ensures code follows best practices.
- **Testing**: Validates data manipulation functions.
- **Notebook Execution**: Runs the notebook and verifies outputs.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab using the provided link.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to see the data manipulation tasks.
